It is also important to create an environment of support and collaboration where people feel safe to ask questions or get help. Additionally, companies can engage with the coding community in meaningful ways and actively promote coding events and meetups. By connecting with excellent teachers and mentors, people can learn coding with guidance, support, and inspiration."
